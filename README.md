Welcome to the Fake News Detection repository! This repository contains a dataset named "Data.csv," enriched with features suitable for supervised machine learning classification. The dataset is accompanied by implementations of seven powerful classification algorithms.

1. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
2. NB (Naive Bayes)
3. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
4. GBC (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
5. LR (Logistic Regression)
6. RFC (Random Forest Classifier)
7. DTC (Decision Tree Claasifier)

You can explore the dataset and leverage the provided algorithms for your Fake News Detection projects. Happy coding!
